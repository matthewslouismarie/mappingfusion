Refactoring:
 - Check SQL is in strict mode
 - Remove certain constraints from the dbâ€¯? (slug for instance) and adapt models so that they correspond to the db. Values should be "prettifyed" only in what interacts with the user. (?)
 - Do we convert to scalars in getters? Do we admit scalars or models in constructors? (?)
 - Method for fetching object from request. (?)
 - Method for updating object from request. (?)
 - Method for preparing form data. (?)
 - Convert routeParams to AppList 

Performance:
 - PHP DI: Make sure is optimised for production: check lazy mode, prod mode.

Security:
 - CSRF
 - XSS
 - Check origin is server settings
 - Search for var_dump and dump on push
 - CSP: remove unsafe-inline
 - Do not display errors in PHP code

Responsiveness:
 - Add srcset to images
 - Add width and height to images
 - viewport
